# Advanced Data Visualization

This project contains an advanced data visualization task performed using Python. The objective was to explore and visualize complex datasets to uncover meaningful insights and patterns. 
The dataset used in this project is the same as the one from our MongoDB project, but here we focus more on the visualization aspect of the data.

## Visualizations Included

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Histograms and density plots
  - Boxplots and violin plots
- **Multivariate Analysis**
  - Scatter plots with regression lines
  - Pair plots and correlation heatmaps
- **Time Series & Trends**
  - Line charts and rolling averages
  - Seasonal decomposition of time-series data
- **Categorical Data Visualization**
  - Bar charts and count plots
  - Treemaps and bubble charts

## Technologies Used

- Python
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, etc
